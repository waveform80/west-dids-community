          <h1>Community Projects</h1>
          <p>Following on from the feedback received from the community survey
          carried out in April-May, we have decided to shelve one project,
          implement a few projects as they are, and ammend other projects, as
          indicated below. We have also had a couple of suggestions for additional
          projects which we will look to implement next year.</p> <p> We welcome
          feedback on any project at any time, and are always looking for
          project suggestions from the community - <a

          <h5>Over 50s Coffee afternoon</h5>
          <p>The coffee afternoon runs from 1:30 to 3:30 pm in Christ Church
          hall on alternate Tuesdays starting from the 12th June 2018. Currently these sessions
          are completely free, however if the sessions are popular we may look
          to implement a small donation to attend each session, to help us
          continue to run them. We aim to provide special workshops or events
          every other month during the sessions. If you have a request for a
          session you would like us to put on, anything from crafts to yoga, let
          us know.</p>
          <p>For full details of the schedule of the sessions and any special events, see the <a href="events.html">Events page</a></p>

          <p>We have a quote for the work from the park ranger of £3,741 to
          provide log edges and wood-chip infill for 50 trees in Mersey Bank
          Park. The installation of such edging will improve the health of the
          trees and promote their growth by providing a weed and grass-free space
          around the base of the trees. When grass and weeds grow right up to
          the trunk of a tree they compete with the trees for water and
          nutrients. This effect is more significant in young trees. Click <a
          href="https://www.treeservicesmagazine.com/tree-health/controlling-weeds-near-trees/">here</a>
          for more information on why edging for young trees is important.</p>

          <h5>West Didsbury Estate Historical Archive</h5>
          <p>We will develop an online archive of the history of the estate.
          This is a long term project with no time limit. When the website has
          been designed and all required forms and privacy documents are in
          place, we will advertise for any residents who are interested to share
          their knowledge of the history of the estate. This could be in the
          form of recorded interviews, either voice, video or in writing, as
          well as personal photos and home movies. We would like to preserve the
          history of the estate so that everyone can benefit from the knowledge
          of how it has changed over the years.</p>
          <p><strong>Status:</strong> Initial planning. Website and documentation being developed.</p>

          <p>We will try and host a community picnic in the park during the
          summer of 2018. The purpose of the event is simply to get people from
          the estate together to share some food and each other's company. When
          all organisation has been completed we will be advertising the event
          using posters on the notice boards.</p>

          <p>After reviewing the feedback from the community survey, we have
          decided to try and implement a walking club for everyone on the
          estate. Depending on the availability of committee members, this
          project may be implemented next year, though we will try to start it
          as soon as possible.</p>

          <h5>West Didsbury Estate Art Competition</h5>
          <p>This idea was not unpopular, but feedback suggests that people are
          concerned that there will be a lack of interest. Therefore we are
          temporarily shelving this project.</p>
          <p><strong>Project Idea:</strong> An art competition for children
          and adults, including entries of short stories, poems,
          drawings/paintings and photos. There would be prizes for the winner
          and runner up in each category. All winning artwork will be posted on
          the community website.</p>
          <p>We could also design a book containing
          as many pieces as possible. The physical book and ebook would be print
          on demand and available from lulu.com, with an expected price of £5
          and £1 respectively. All profits would be spent by the group on other
          community projects.</p>
          <p><strong>Costs:</strong> Approximately £200 for prizes, however we would also look for some
          sponsorship.</p>
